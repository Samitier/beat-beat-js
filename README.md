#Beat-Beat JS

Do you want to make things move with your music? This is a very simple library to analyze and detect the beats of a song.

Using the WebAudioAPI and a couple of filters, this lib is capable of analyzing the parts of a song that may mark the rythm of a song.
It then executes a callback each time the song reaches a beat.

Depending on the genre of the song, this lib may not work. It usually works better with songs with deep percussion, like techno, house, etc.
